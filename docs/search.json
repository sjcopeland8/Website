The field work will occur at several pairs of high alpine lakes. Each pair contains one lake artificially stocked with fish, the other is un-stocked (no fish). Research questions can take on a variety of different topics, as long as they are focused on this high alpine lake habitat. Please reach out to me via email if you’re interested.\n\n\n\n",
