This has been a question plaguing the EEMB first-year cohort. EEMB 509 - Introduction to Principles of Ecology and Evolution is where the topic at hand developed. The astutely observant first-years noticed the pronunciation of said "Niche" had created its own "Niches" So is it pronounced "Neech" or "Nitch"?
